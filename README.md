# extension-reloader
Reloads other extensions with a hotkey

### Description

Reload all active extensions with a hotkey

If you've ever developed a Google Chromeâ„¢ extension, you might have wanted to automate the process of reloading your unpacked extension without the need of going through the extensions page.

Whenever a refresh is executed, a notification will show.

** This extension is open-source and available on GitHub:
https://github.com/gkshi/extension-reloader

P.S.: was inspired by the deprecated Extension Reloader (arikw)
